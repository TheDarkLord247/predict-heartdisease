# Heart Disease Prevention
This is a data science project contained in a Python notebook that reads patients' stroke data, analyzes relationships between different features, processes different features leveraging p-value analysis and dimensionality reduction, and trains multiple ML classifier models to predict a patient's susceptibility of getting a stroke. <br/> <br/>
Please refer to the notebook for the code, the csv file for the data and the pdf for an in-depth report of my findings.
